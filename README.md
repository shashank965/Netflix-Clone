# Netflix Clone

Welcome to my Netflix Clone project! This web application is a front-end replica of Netflix, built using HTML and CSS. The project aims to mimic the visual layout and design of Netflix, providing a user-friendly interface that includes a navigation bar, movie thumbnails, and responsive design elements. This project is a great demonstration of my skills in HTML and CSS, showcasing my ability to create visually appealing and responsive web pages.

## Features

- Responsive design that adjusts to various screen sizes
- Navigation bar similar to Netflix
- Movie thumbnails and descriptions
- Clean and structured code

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback. Contributions are welcome!
